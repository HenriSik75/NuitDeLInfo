NuitDeLInfo
===========

This is a sample repository to host your source code.

### TODO

Here this is our first time we work on Javascript language. For this challenge, we just add some animations pictures
about the special event called "La nuit de l'info".
This challenge is accepted by the team "DROP_DATABASE" which these members worked on:
-Maintrot SÃ©bastien
-Duplaix Gabriel
-Baron David
-Sik Henri

Here we used the "javascript carousel" to illustrate you the diaporama.
